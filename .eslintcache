For that mechanic, whenever 2 pieces of the same robot collide,\r\n                            the game instantiates an “empty” object with 3 separate attachment points,\r\n                            and then attaches each piece to its corresponding points.\r\n                            When all 3 pieces are parented to their points,\r\n                            the object is removed and replaced with the playable character.\r\n                            The original playable character is removed, and in its position 3 pieces are spawned.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            A similar process is used for when the player presses the “detonate” button:\r\n                            the incomplete robot object releases its pieces from the attachment points and then deletes itself.\r\n                            A small cooldown is implemented to prevent pieces from immediately reattaching as soon as the player releases them.\r\n                            Overall, I’m extremely happy with this project, although sadly it is a little buggy.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </DialogContent>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","D:\\GitHub\\PortfolioReact\\src\\components\\pages\\Metroid.tsx",["46"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport metroidScrn from '../../assets/images/projects/metroid/metroidScrn.png';\r\nimport { DialogContent, DialogTitle } from \"@material-ui/core\";\r\nimport metroidCard from \"../../assets/images/projects/metroid/metroid_card.png\";\r\n\r\nexport function MetroidCard() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <img src={metroidCard} />\r\n            <h3>METROID PRIME-LIKE FPS</h3>\r\n        </>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function MetroidContent() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"project-modal__modal\">\r\n            <DialogTitle>\r\n                <h1 className=\"project-modal__modal__title\">Metroid Prime-style First Person Shooter</h1>\r\n            </DialogTitle>\r\n            <DialogContent>\r\n                <div className=\"project-modal__modal__content\">\r\n                    <div className=\"project-modal__modal__content__header\">\r\n                        <div className=\"project-modal__modal__content__header__image\">\r\n                            <img src={metroidScrn} alt=\"A screenshot of Fragmental, showing one of the puzzle rooms with 3 doors and one of the playable robots.\" />\r\n                            <a href=\"https://watsondynamite.itch.io/metroid-like-concept\">Itch.io Download Link</a>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <span className=\"project-modal__modal__content__header__intro\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                The main goal of this project was the implementation of an FPS aiming system reminiscent of the Metroid Prime games,\r\n                                in which, contrary to the majority of modern FPSs,\r\n                                the aiming crosshair is not confined to the very center point of the screen and is instead mobile\r\n                                and controllable by the player, allowing aiming within a portion of the screen without rotating the camera.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </span>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"project-modal__modal__content__body\">\r\n                        <p>Controls:</p>\r\n                        <span>\r\n                            WASD - movement\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            Spacebar - Jump\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            Mouse - Aim\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            Scroll Wheel - Change Temperature\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            E near the button - spawn enemy\r\n                        </span>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The main goal of this project was the implementation of an FPS aiming system reminiscent of the Metroid Prime games,\r\n                            in which, contrary to the majority of modern FPSs,\r\n                            the aiming crosshair is not confined to the very center point of the screen and is instead mobile\r\n                            and controllable by the player, allowing aiming within a portion of the screen without rotating the camera.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Additionally to this, I also wished to experiment with a gameplay mechanic involving\r\n                            manipulating the temperature of the player character’s suit, thus altering the properties of\r\n                            the projectiles fired by the weapon. The spawnable skull enemy reacts differently to different\r\n                            shot temperatures: cold temperatures will gradually freeze it, causing it to fall down and shatter into pieces,\r\n                            while hot temperatures will light it on fire, causing it to become aggressive.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Finally, this game also served as a test for DOOM-styled enemies and UI elements reminiscent of the PlayStation era,\r\n                            utilizing pre-rendered sprites made from 3D models.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The main challenge of this project was correctly firing the projectile to the direction intended by the player.\r\n                            The solution was to cast a ray from the camera towards the equivalent direction in the world space of the aiming\r\n                            crosshair, using Camera.ScreenToWorldSpace().\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            That ray is used as the direction vector for another raycast that finds the first collidable object in its path.\r\n                            That collision point is used as the direction towards which the projectile is fired from the gun model. If no target is found,\r\n                            the aiming direction is simply a point very far away from the player in world space in the direction calculated from the aiming\r\n                            crosshair.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            As for the DOOM-style enemy sprite effect, the sprites originate from a 5 sprite sheet displaying\r\n                            5 viewing angles of the sprite. The sprite renderer is always facing the player (for a “billboarding” effect),\r\n                            but the enemy itself has its own rotation.

One of the main challenges was\r\n                            getting the turn system to work properly, especially when attacking results in the death of one of\r\n                            the monsters. Since it’s a game mostly around calculations and stats, it was also a challenge to plan\r\n                            out the data structures that would allow me to define the properties of monsters and attacks, as well\r\n                            as implementing the effects of each attack.\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            In addition, of all the small games and projects I’ve done over the years, this one was the one that really got my software engineering brain going.\r\n                            It was the first time I had worked with data structures in a game development environment, since it was the first time I\r\n                            needed to work on a game whose mechanics weren't assisted by the real-time aspect of the Unity engine.\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            The environment’s models and textures are free assets. The UI graphics are a mix of Unity’s default UI sprites and custom made ones.\r\n                            The monsters themselves are the “Fiery” and “Cyclopes” “Boximon” assets made by Meshtint Studio.\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            In the future, I am planning to implement networking, more playable creatures, as well as collaborate with artists in order to develop the game’s style and creatures.\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            I’ve also created a Youtube Playlist in which I upload progress update videos showcasing the functionalities I implement into the project.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </DialogContent>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}",{"ruleId":"48","replacedBy":"49"},{"ruleId":"50","replacedBy":"51"},{"ruleId":"52","severity":1,"message":"53","line":4,"column":10,"nodeType":"54","messageId":"55","endLine":4,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"56","severity":1,"message":"57","line":10,"column":13,"nodeType":"58","endLine":10,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"56","severity":1,"message":"57","line":9,"column":13,"nodeType":"58","endLine":9,"endColumn":38},{"ruleId":"56","severity":1,"message":"57","line":11,"column":13,"nodeType":"58","endLine":11,"endColumn":38},"no-native-reassign",["59"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["60"],"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars","'FormLabel' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
